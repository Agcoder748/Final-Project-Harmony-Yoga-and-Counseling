          Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or
          disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six
          Ä€stika schools of Indian philosophical traditions. Various styles of
          yoga combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation
          or relaxation.
